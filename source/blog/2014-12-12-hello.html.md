Hello.  We are happy to announce that version 1.0 of Heart Rate Touch is now available in the App Store.  Heart Rate Touch is all about accuracy, ease of use, and privacy.  Almost as important in what we are releasing in this app is what we are not releasing.  No ads, no in-app purchases, no pesky upsells.  The app does one thing really well--measure your heart rate.

Apps don't just appear in the store.  They are the culmination of ideas, design and implementation.  We learned a lot putting this app in the store and continue to learn a lot.  Our hope is that this blog can serve as an outlet to share some the things we learn.
