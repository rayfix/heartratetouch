Hello.  We are happy to announce that version 1.0 of Heart Rate Touch is now available in the app store.  In this release we are striving for accuracy, ease of use, and privacy.  Almost as important in what we are releasing in this app is what we are not releasing.  No ads, no in-app purchases, no pesky upsells.  The main goal of the app is one thing--to measure your heart rate.

Apps don't just appear in the store.  They are the culmination of a lot of though, design and implementation.  We learned a lot putting this app in the store and continue to learn a lot.  Our hope is that this blog can serve as an outlet to share the things we learn.
