Mark Bangs of appPicker wrote the <a href="http://www.apppicker.com/reviews/20640/heart-rate-touch-app-review-take-heart">first review Heart Rate Touch</a>.  He concludes, "Heart Rate Touch is definitely one of the best heart rate measurement apps for iPhone and iPad at the moment, earning it a solid recommendation from me."  Hard to argue with that. We agree. :)
