        <dt>How does it work?</dt>
        <dd>Optical heart rate monitors use light to track your blood. By illuminating your capillaries in your finger-tip with a light source (Flash), a sensor (Camera) adjacent to the light measures the frequency (Heart Rate in beats per minute [bpm]) at which your blood pumps from the "redness" of the images it captures.
        </dd>
        
        <dt>What is the best way to measure?</dt>
        <dd>Cover the both the flash and the camera with your finger.  Apply a steady, light
            pressure.  A great way to do this is by resting the phone on your finger and
            let the weight of the phone do the work.  Keeping still while the measurement
            is made also helps. For example, it is best to not talk while making a measurement.  If you are having trouble getting a steady signal, you may find using a different finger helps.

        <dt>How accurate are the measurements?</dt>
        <dd>Heart Rate Touch uses sophisticated methods to keep measurements accurate.  Under
            ideal conditions, with constant pressure and minimal user movement, measurements are
            accurate to within one beat per minute (bpm).  Your results may vary.</dd>
        
        <dt>Can I export to the Apple Health app?</dt>
        <dd>The first time you make a measurement, you will be asked if you would like to export measurements.</dd>
        
        <dt>Can I export my information to other apps?</dt>
        <dd>Yes.  Go to "History" and then tap on the 'Share' button.  You can share your measurements with Mail, Airdrop, or even other apps such as Apple's Numbers.</dd>
        
        <dt>Can I delete a measurement?</dt>
        <dd>Yes.  Under history, swipe the measurement and confirm the deletion.  If the measurement
            was exported to the Apple Health app, it will be deleted from there as well.

        <dd>Pelfunc does not collect any user information or talk back to a server, the measurements
            remain private within the user context.</dd>
